## Patient Data Analysis Project

This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical investigation on a healthcare dataset using Python. It includes data cleaning, descriptive statistics, visualizations, and hypothesis testing to uncover patterns and relationships among patient health indicators.

### Key Features

- **Data Exploration**
  - Display sample records
  - Detect and count missing values
  - Gender distribution and average BMI

- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Summary stats for Age, BMI, Hospital Visits, and Exercise Frequency
  - Identify patients with extreme values
  - Most common cholesterol category

- **Data Visualization**
  - Histogram of Age
  - Boxplot of BMI by Gender
  - Countplot of Smoking Status
  - Scatter plot: BMI vs Exercise Frequency
  - Pie chart: Medication Adherence
  - Heatmap: Correlation matrix

- **Statistical Tests**
  - **Chi-Square Tests**: Gender vs Smoking Status, Diabetes vs Blood Pressure
  - **T-Test**: BMI comparison between Male and Female patients
  - **ANOVA**: Exercise Frequency across Medication Adherence levels

- **Correlation Analysis**
  - Compute and visualize the correlation matrix
  - Identify the strongest positive and negative relationships

### 📦 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook (GitHub Codespaces)
